## Props

#### code: String

See `react-live` for the kind of React code you can use here. Pure JSX works because `react-live` pre-renders.

#### scope: Object,

To use global packages other than React (included by default), you have to scope them into `react-live`. More info in the [react-live README](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live#how-does-the-scope-work).

#### editorClass: String,

CSS class name you can apply to style the [Live Editor](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live#liveeditor-)
