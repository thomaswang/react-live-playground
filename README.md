## Props

#### code: String

See [React Live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live) for the kind of React code you can use here. Pure JSX works because `react-live` pre-renders.

#### theme: Object

A `prism-react-renderer` theme object. See more in the [README for prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer#theming).

#### scope: Object

To use global packages other than React (included by default), you have to scope them into `react-live`. More info in the [react-live README](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live#how-does-the-scope-work).

### Other LiveProvider Props

`noInline`, `transformCode`, `language`, `disabled` -> These can be found in the [`<LiveProvider />` README section](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live#liveprovider-)

#### editorClass: String

CSS class name you can apply to style the [Live Editor](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live#liveeditor-)

#### errorClass: String
